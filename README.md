# ATTACK
This project aims to develop an interactive game played on a SUR40 monitor.
Development is mainly done as part of the course DH2413 Advanced Graphics and Interaction 
given at KTH, Royal Institute of Technology.

## Gameplay
The game is played using cards, similar to how you would play traditional card 
games such as "Yu Gi Oh!" or "Magic the Gathering", by placing them on the SUR40 monitor.

When cards are placed onto the screen, characters are summoned for each of the two players.
The characters then fight, and the last man standing wins!
